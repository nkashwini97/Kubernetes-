Deployment strategies, such as Blue-Green, 
Canary, and Rolling, differ in how they release 
new application versions by managing infrastructure,
risk, and user impact. Blue-Green deployments duplicate 
infrastructure for rapid rollback but introduce risk with a 
single switch, while Canary deployments gradually expose new versions 
to small user subsets for early testing and risk mitigation. 
Rolling deployments incrementally replace old instances with new ones,
offering a controlled, gradual update but potentially taking longer. 
The best strategy depends on the application, team capabilities, and goals, 
with feature toggles providing an additional layer of control by separating 
deployment from release. 


Here's a comparison of key deployment 
strategies:
1. Blue-Green Deployment
How it works:
Two identical production environments 


are maintained: "Blue" (current version) and "Green" (new version). Once the new version is ready and tested, all user traffic is immediately switched to the "Green" environment. 
Pros:
Near-instant rollback by redirecting traffic back to the stable "Blue" environment. 
Cons:
Increased infrastructure costs due to duplication, and all users are exposed to the new version at once, potentially increasing the blast radius of issues. 
Best for:
Major upgrades or changes where a fast rollback is critical. 
2. Canary Deployment
How it works:
The new version is released to a small, isolated subset of users (a "canary") for monitoring and testing. Traffic is gradually shifted to the new version if performance is good. 
Pros:
Significantly reduces the risk and impact of potential bugs, as only a small group of users is affected. Allows for real-world testing with minimal risk. 
Cons:
Can be more complex to manage, and requires careful monitoring and traffic management. 
Best for:
High-risk changes or when gathering real-world feedback is essential. 
3. Rolling Deployment
How it works:
New instances of the application are added while old instances are removed, gradually replacing the entire set of servers with the new version. 
Pros:
Less resource-intensive than Blue-Green, as it doesn't require duplicating the entire environment. Provides a controlled, incremental update. 
Cons:
The update process takes more time, and if the new version has an issue, it affects an increasing number of users before you can fully roll back. 
Best for:
Applications that can tolerate gradual updates and when infrastructure duplication is not feasible.
