Deployment strategies, such as Blue-Green, 
Canary, and Rolling, differ in how they release 
new application versions by managing infrastructure,
risk, and user impact. Blue-Green deployments duplicate 
infrastructure for rapid rollback but introduce risk with a 
single switch, while Canary deployments gradually expose new versions 
to small user subsets for early testing and risk mitigation. 
Rolling deployments incrementally replace old instances with new ones,
offering a controlled, gradual update but potentially taking longer. 
The best strategy depends on the application, team capabilities, and goals, 
with feature toggles providing an additional layer of control by separating 
deployment from release.
